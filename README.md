- As a guest (not logged-in), when I search github for the term "create-react-app" from the landing page search input, I see:
  - A count of matching results
  - The facebook/create-create-app project as the first result
- As a guest, when I click the "About" button in the landing page footer I am taken to the GitHub "About" page
